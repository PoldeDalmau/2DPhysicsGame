# 2DPhysicsGame
A start to make a game that uses solid balls and the physics that governs them. 

500 balls are initialized at rest. An extra ball is initialized with a velocity and in red. Quickly, we see that through collisions, the system begins to behave like an ideal gas. See the velocity (unitless) histogram at the bottom right.

The engine now can include a squishy car that can be controlled with the keys A and D to move, space to jump, and V to view all the spring forces acting.
